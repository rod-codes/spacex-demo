# SpaceX API Demo

## Introduction

The brief was to use any language to create a timeline of SpaceX launches.

I liked the mission patches and decided to use that as the icons.

Furthermore, using a graph database allows you to show the reuse of the rockets and I think
that is the interesting aspect. Next potential improvements, would be to show which ships they used
and if any ships serviced the same core repeatedly.
